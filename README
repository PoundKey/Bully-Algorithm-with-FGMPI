Dear TA,

Please refer to the test_x.txt to view the test files. 
These are the test cases demo how the program is being tested.


Interesting notices:
when the input value of -nfg is relative small, say between 2-5, 
node 1 and node 2 will result in 1-7 seconds of delay on receving messages. 
Whereas when -nfg > 10, everything works perfectly. (max. around 1000 processes+thread in total tested).

I have given my best try on this assignment. So please take some time going over the code if you have any concerns.

Thanks.

Regard,
Chang
