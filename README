Dear TA,

Please refer to the test_x.txt to view the test files. 
These are the test cases demo how the program is being tested.

Known Issue: Since the recv function is written in a blocking style, meaning that
the program will have to finish processing current message before can handle and process
further messages. It seems like the FG-MPI/MPI sets a limit for the message buffer queue, 
so that when messages on the buffer queue reaches certain amount of number, 
the program will hang up and stop receving any further messages. 

Because of this problem, this implementation would not be able to take too many nodes.
With -nfg 4, the program and the bully algorithm works perfectly. However when -nfg > 5,
there are chances that this program many hang up indefinitely due to a full message  buffer queue.

I have given my best try on this assignment.

Thanks.

Regard,
Chang
